<h1 class="style-title">Typography</h1>

<p>
	A basic set of semantic elements used as a base for project style guides.
</p>


<p>
	Here’s a quick list of elements (as styled by Github):
</p>


<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>

<blockquote>
	<p>This is a block quote</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	<h1>This is also a blockquote</h1>
	
	<p>
		This blockquote has different types of content within it. 
		A heading, some paragraph text, and a list:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Item 1</li>
		<li>Item 2</li>
		<li>Item 3</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>This is item 1 in a bulleted list</li>
	<li>This is item 2</li>
	<li>This is item 3</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Text can have <em>italics</em>, 
	<strong>bold bits</strong> and <a href="http://madebyfieldwork.com">Hyperlinks to other places</a>
</p>

<h2>More Info</h2>

<p>Here’s more detail about how they’re used:</p>

<h3>Headings</h3>

<h4>H1: First level heading</h4>

<p>
	Main heading, usually only used once on a page, and usually the page title.
</p>

<h4>H2: Second level heading</h4>

<p>
	A sub-heading, usually used to title sections within a page. Can be used multiple times on a page.
</p>

<h4>H3-6: Lower level headings</h4>

<p>
	H3 is usually enough, but headings can go down to a sixth-level.
</p>

<h3>Blockquotes</h3>

<p>
	A blockquote is quoted content. It can contain pretty much any content (headings, lists, paragraphs, etc.) and is usually used for things like pull quotes or citations from other sources.
</p>

<h3>Lists &amp; Paras</h3>

<p>
	Lists and paragraphs are pretty self-exaplanitory—see examples above.
